A brief comparison between Hong Kong and Chinese GDP per capita between 1960 and 2010. PDF file has pretty formatting!

The intent behind this project is to showcase the effect of education spending over time and the subsequent effect on GDP per capita. Given the differences in economies, Hong Kong and China provide a unique case study on East Asian economic development due to GDP per capita being comparable in 1960, but vastly distinct by 2010.

I explore the effects of education spending by first using a static model, followed by a dynamic model with GDP per capita variables. This is done for both Hong Kong and Chinese data.

Then, I combine the data for a factor analysis and conclusion.

Effects appear to be negligible, with too few data points to reliably explain the differences in GDP per capita. Further analysis should be done with larger lagged variables, difference in differences, and inclusion of trade data for greater detail in analysis.

An additional explanation for the results might also stem from the lack of data. Large swaths of data points were missing from both the available Hong Kong and China datasets. If more data becomes available, a reanalysis would be appropriate. Moreover, the accuracy and validity of data provided is difficult to evaluate , bringing data governance into the equation.
